# r-dailyprogrammer
This repository contains my solutions to the programming challenges posted in Reddit's subreddit r/dailyprogrammer. Each solution will be uploaded in a single file (or folder if I've used more than one file) that will contain the complete description of the challenge as a first line comment that will be named using the following naming system:

*[Difficulty] - [#challenge] -- YYYY-MM-DD*

I plan writing the solutions in Python, but in case I'll use another language in any challenge, I'll indicate it at the end of its name.

Probably I won't upload the solution to every single challenge, because unfortunately I don't think that I can solve all of them, but in case you'd like to see a single one that I haven't uploaded don't hesitate to ask and I'll try to solve it! And, of course, any feedback will be more than appreciated!
